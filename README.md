# SimpleBlockchain

Creating a simple blockchain program.

## Build

I build it using CMake, if you don't want to you can take the source files and build it your way or use my instructions below.

### My Way

I build it in a folder to keep it clean and delete everythign generated when needed.

```
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..

```
if all things goes smoothly you can a folder called bin with the solution/makefiles.
